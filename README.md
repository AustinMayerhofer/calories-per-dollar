# calories-per-dollar
Enter calories per serving, enter serving size, enter price, and get calories per dollar.

Will do it automatically (as the user inputs the numbers).

Button to save the food item with an optional title (or does it upon the button press). Main reason for this is to have a "Gold Standard" item with the best calories per dollar that the user has found, which is always displayed on the main page, so the user has a metric to understand purchases. User would be able to view all saved food items.

Do it in Android Studio in Java. Figure out what Java library to use for data frames.

Calories per serving entry, number of servings entry (default 1), price entry, box for "Gold Standard" food item (or user's chosen gold standard. Or just a button a ranking of all user's item). Executes calculation upon each number entry. Button to save entry in to ranking (with a title). We'd save a .csv file with all the users' previous entries.
