Enter calories, enter serving size, enter price, and get calories per dollar.

Will do it automatically (as the user inputs the numbers) or does it upon a button press.

Button to save the food item with an optional title (or does it upon the button press). Main reason for this is to have a "Gold Standard" item with the best calories per dollar that the user has found, which is always displayed on the main page, so the user has a metric to understand purchases. User would be able to view all saved food items.

Done in Android Studio in Java.
